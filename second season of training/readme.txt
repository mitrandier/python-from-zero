📌 Project: Sum of Numbers from 1 to N (Python)
📖 Description:

This is a simple Python program that asks the user to enter a number and then calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 up to that number.

The program uses:

input() for user input

for loop for iteration

basic arithmetic operations

It is suitable for beginners who are learning Python fundamentals such as loops, variables, and user input.


🧠 What the Program Does:

Prompts the user to enter a number.

Iterates from 1 to n.

Adds each number to a running total.

Prints the intermediate sum and the final result.

▶️ Example Output
Hi please enter your number:
5
1
the sum of 1 to 5 is :  1
3
the sum of 1 to 5 is :  3
6
the sum of 1 to 5 is :  6
10
the sum of 1 to 5 is :  10
15
the sum of 1 to 5 is :  15
