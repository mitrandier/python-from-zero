Description

This program reads two numbers from the user and calculates the result of raising the first number to the power of the second one. Before performing the calculation, the program validates the input values to ensure they are within an acceptable range.

How It Works

The user enters two numbers separated by a space.

The first number (a) must be between 1 and 100.

The second number (b) must be between 0 and 30.

If both numbers are valid, the program prints a raised to the power of b.

If the input values are outside the allowed ranges, the program prints an error message.

Input Rules

a: integer between 1 and 100

b: integer between 0 and 30

Output

Prints the result of a ** b if the inputs are valid.

Prints "invalid numbers" if the inputs are not valid.

Example

Input:

2 3


Output:

8

Notes

This program helps prevent invalid calculations by checking input limits before performing the power operation
