Hello,
This is my first file for getting started with the Python programming language.

In this file, I practiced the following basic concepts and commands:

Mathematical operations: addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation

Parentheses and operator precedence

Data types: int and float

Conditional statements: if / else

Comparison operators

Prime number checking

Printing values and outputs

The purpose of this file is to practice and understand the fundamental concepts of Python.
