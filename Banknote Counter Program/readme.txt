💰 Banknote Counter Program (Python)
📌 Description

This program takes an integer number as input and calculates the minimum number of banknotes needed to represent that amount using the following denominations:

100

50

20

10

5

1

The program processes the number step by step, subtracting each denomination and keeping track of the remaining amount.

⚙️ How It Works

The user enters an integer number.

The program calculates how many 100-value notes are needed.

The remaining value is then checked for 50-value notes.

This process continues for 20, 10, 5, and finally 1.

At the end, the program prints:

The number of each banknote

The total count of banknotes used

▶️ Example

Input:

186


Output:

sad = 1
panjah = 1
bist = 1
dah = 1
panj = 1
yek = 1
total = 6

🧠 Concepts Used

Integer division (//)

Modulus operator (%)

User input handling

Step-by-step remainder calculation

🚀 Usage

Run the program and enter any positive integer to see how it can be broken down into banknotes efficiently.

📝 Notes

The program assumes valid integer input.
