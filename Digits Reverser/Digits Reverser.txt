📌 Description

This program takes an integer number as input and reverses its digits, then prints the reversed number as output.

⚙️ How It Works

The program receives an integer input from the user.

It extracts each digit of the number using division (//) and modulo (%) operations.

Each extracted digit is converted into a string.

Finally, the digits are concatenated in reverse order and printed.

🧮 Example

Input:

1234


Output:

4321
