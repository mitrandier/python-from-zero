📌 Python Practice: Functions and Lists
📖 Description

This project is a beginner-level Python practice focused on understanding functions, lists, loops, and conditional logic. The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills by implementing simple logic manually instead of relying on built-in functions.

🎯 Project Goals

Practice defining and using functions

Work with lists of numbers

Understand how to iterate through list elements

Learn how to find the minimum value using logical comparisons

Improve familiarity with basic Python syntax

🧠 What Is Covered

Creating functions that return values

Using functions inside calculations

Iterating over a list using loops

Comparing values to determine the smallest element

Understanding list length and indexing

👶 Skill Level

Beginner (Python fundamentals)

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.x

Basic understanding of variables and loops

📚 Learning Outcome

After reviewing or running this project, learners will have a clearer understanding of how:

Functions work in Python

Lists are accessed and processed

Logical conditions are used to solve simple problems

✨ Notes

Some parts of the project were used as practice and experimentation during learning and are kept for educational purposes.
